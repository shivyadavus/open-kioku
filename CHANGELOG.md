- Added reversible compressed context handles with local original retrieval.
- Added optional TOON output for context packs, compressed context packs, and pre-edit plans.

### Changed

## [1.0.1] — 2026-06-04

### Changed
- Added crates.io publishing metadata and versioned internal workspace dependencies.
- Reduced README duplication and focused the getting-started path on install, index, verify, and MCP setup.
- Updated npm, Cursor, and demo package metadata for the 1.0.1 release.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-04

### Added
- Added phase-level indexing progress for CLI indexing, benchmark, and proof flows.
- Added an index writer lock to prevent concurrent SQLite/Tantivy writers from corrupting or racing index updates.
- Added bounded context and planning paths that reuse persisted Tantivy search results for large repositories.
- Added fast validation-target selection for large repositories.

### Changed
- Replaced heuristic reference expansion with exact definition occurrences plus SCIP-imported occurrences when available.
- Optimized graph construction, Tantivy rebuilds, symbol definition lookup, context building, planning, and test selection for large repositories.
- Expanded default excludes for dependency, build, generated, and internal index paths.

### Fixed
- Fixed indexing blowups caused by highly repeated method and property names in large repositories.
- Fixed JSON and YAML files emitting every key as a symbol.
- Fixed duplicate chunk and symbol records around same-line symbol boundaries.
- Fixed `patch review --json` to return structured JSON.
- Fixed `symbol definition` ranking so exact class/interface definitions beat lower-quality prefix matches.
- Documented the recommended MCP pre-edit routine for Claude Code, Cursor, and other MCP clients.

## [0.1.4] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- Added npm package READMEs for the main wrapper package and platform-specific binary packages.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-05-26

### Fixed
- Fixed release packaging for cross-compiled Linux arm64 binaries by skipping host `strip` on incompatible targets.
- Synced Cursor and npm package manifests with the canonical workspace version.
- Extended version validation so CI catches npm wrapper and platform package drift before release.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-25

### Added
- **Enhanced health checks** via `ok doctor` with Rust toolchain, Tree-sitter parsers, and MCP initialize checks
- **Signed release binaries** via GitHub Actions with SHA256 checksums and cross-compilation for musl/darwin
- **Fixture repositories** (Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go) and integration tests under `open-kioku-tests`
- **Search evidence wiring** — search results now provide explanatory evidence strings and normalized confidence scores
- **Experimental tool labeling** — `tools/list` differentiates stable vs experimental tools with `--hide-experimental` flag
- **Write safety** — `apply_patch` handler gated behind `OPEN_KIOKU_ALLOW_WRITE=1` environment variable
- **Context export formats** — `build_context_pack` supports JSON, Markdown, and PromptText formats
- **Performance benchmarks** — `ok bench` CLI command and criterion benchmarks under `benches/`
- **MCP server** (`ok mcp serve`) — full Model Context Protocol implementation over stdio with 35+ tools covering search, symbol navigation, impact analysis, architecture detection, and patch planning
- **BM25 / Tantivy search index** — disk-backed full-text search across all indexed code chunks (`search_code`, `regex_search`, `semantic_search`)
- **Tree-sitter parser** — precise symbol extraction for Rust, Java, Python, TypeScript, and Go (`get_definition`, `get_references`, `get_callers`, `get_callees`, `get_implementations`)
- **SQLite metadata graph** — file manifest, symbol table, and dependency graph stored under `.ok/` (`impact_analysis`, `dependency_path`, `module_dependencies`)
- **Architecture detector** — infers high-level component boundaries from file paths (`detect_architecture`, `architecture_violations`)
- **Context pack builder** — assembles AI-ready bundles of primary files, symbols, and tests for a task (`build_context_pack`)
- **Patch planner** — plans code changes without writing files (`propose_patch`, `review_patch`, `validate_patch`)
- **Security posture** — read-only by default; secret paths (`.env`, `.aws`, `.ssh`) blocked from indexing; `apply_patch` gated behind `allow_write: true`
- **Claude Code marketplace manifest** (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `skills/open-kioku/SKILL.md`)
- **Cursor marketplace manifest** (`.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` and `.cursor-plugin/skills/open-kioku.mdc`)
- **CLI** (`ok init`, `ok index`, `ok search`, `ok symbol`, `ok context`, `ok impact`, `ok tests`, `ok status`)

### Fixed
- `serverInfo.name` in MCP `initialize` response corrected to `open-kioku`
- `repository` URL in `Cargo.toml` corrected to `https://github.com/shivyadavus/open-kioku`
- `claude_plugin.json` updated to use `${workspaceFolder}` instead of hardcoded `.`
- LICENSE copyright holder updated to Shiv Yadav
- Added `NOTICE` file as required by Apache License 2.0
